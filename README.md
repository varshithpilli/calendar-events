# A simple Calender format event tracker

## Made using vanilla JS, this webpage acts as an alternative to on device calender.

Key points
* Calender UI making it easier to understand.
* Count down to the events, so you wouldn't forget.
* The events can be added, deleted, modified.
* Stores locally so no worries of data loss when refreshed.
